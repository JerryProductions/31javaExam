PROBLEMS
2.3 Write statements to accomplish each of the following tasks:
a)	Declare variables c, thisIsAVariable, 176354 and number to be of type int.
b)	Prompt the user to enter an integer.
c)	Input an integer and assign the result to int variable value. Assume Scanner variable input can be used to read a value from the keyboard.
d)	Print "This is a Java program" on one line in the command window. Use method System.out.println.
e)	Print "This is a Java program" on two lines in the command window. The first line should end with Java. Use method System.out.println.
f)	Print "This is a Java program" on two lines in the command window. The first line should end with Java. Use method System.out.printf and two %s format specifiers.
g)	If the variable number is not equal to 7, display "The variable number is not equal to 7".

2.5 Write declarations, statements or comments that accomplish each of the following tasks:
a)	State that a program will calculate the product of three integers.
b)	Create a Scanner called input that reads values from the standard input.
c)	Declare the variables x, y, z and result to be of type int.
d)	Prompt the user to enter the first integer.
e)	Read the first integer from the user and store it in the variable x.
f)	Prompt the user to enter the second integer.
g)	Read the second integer from the user and store it in the variable y.
h)	Prompt the user to enter the third integer.
i)	Read the third integer from the user and store it in the variable z.
j)	Compute the product of the three integers contained in variables x, y and z, and assign the result to the variable result.
k)	Display the message "Product is" followed by the value of the variable result.

2.6 Using the statements you wrote in Exercise 2.5, write a complete program that calculates and prints the product of three integers.
