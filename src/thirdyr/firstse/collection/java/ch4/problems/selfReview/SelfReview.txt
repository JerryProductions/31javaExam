PROBLEMS
4.5	Write a Java statement to accomplish each of the following tasks:
a)	Declare variables sum and x to be type of int.
b)	Assign 1 to variable x.
c)	Assign 0 to variable sum.
d)	Add variable x to variable sum, and assign the result to variable sum.
e)	Print "The sum is: ", followed by the value of variable sum.

4.6	Combine the statements that you wrote in Exercise 4.5 into a Java application that calculates and prints the sum of the integers from 1 to 10. Use a while statement to loop through the calculation and increment statements. The loop should terminate when the value of x becomes 11.

ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS
4.5
a)	int sum, x;
	or
	int sum;
	int x;
b)	x = 1;
c)	sum = 0;
d)	sum = sum + x;
e)	System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);

4.5 PROGRAM
public class Calculate {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int sum;
		int x;
		
		x = 1;
		sum = 0;
		
		while (x <= 10) {
			sum = sum + x;
			x = x + 1;
		}
		
		System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
	}
